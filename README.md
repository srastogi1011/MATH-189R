Hello, this is my NBA basketball analytics project.

This project implements a logistic regression classifier model to solve the problem of predicting the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of a National Basketball Association (NBA) season based on player season statistics. It then corroborates this prediction using Principal Component Analysis and kMeans clustering to compare players.

The final paper is titled Player_Comparison.pdf and can be found in the Final Project folder. 

The code for the regression model can be found in the Midterm Project folder and the code for the PCA/kMeans analysis can be found in the Final Project folder.

Please email srastogi1011@gmail.com for any questions, comments, or concerns. Thanks!
